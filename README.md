# UselessLibrary
my inutile library so i want to clarify that the functions will be explained on the page sites.google.com/cssdd.ca/ExtremeTech/uselessLibrary
update:now you have to write uselessLibrary.var for the functions you want to use since i made it an object:uselessLibrary.tetration(2,2)//will not write anything because it's a return function and not a console.log
